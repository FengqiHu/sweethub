Competent friends can carry out secondary development.
* You can help Xiaobai build it on Xianyu, but you are not allowed to sell the source code. It must be declared as an open source project.
* It is forbidden to sell it in any way. All consequences are at your own risk. The author will definitely investigate if it violates the original intention of the project.
* The original intention of developing this project is to learn deeply and communicate widely, so as to enrich our knowledge base and improve self-cultivation.
* If you can bring a little joy and pleasure to your partner in the process, it is undoubtedly an additional affirmation of my development and a gratifying thing.

### Project Statement
